*This project is a part of [The SOOMLA Project](http://project.soom.la) which is a series of open source initiatives with a joint goal to help mobile game developers get better stores and more in-app purchases.*

Haven't you ever wanted an in-app purchase one liner that looks like this ?!

```Java
    StoreInventory.buy("[SOOMLA itemId]");
```

android-store
---
**The new Virtual Economy model V3 is merged to master. The new model has many new features and it works better than the old one. Old applications may break b/c of the use in this new model. Already published games with android-store from before May 1st, 2013 needs to clone the project with tag v2.2.**  


The android-store is our first open code initiative as part of The SOOMLA Project. It is a Java API that simplifies Google Play's in-app purchasing API and complements it with storage, security and event handling. The project also includes a sample app for reference. 

>If you also want to create a **storefront** you can do that using our [Store Designer](http://designer.soom.la).


Check out our [Wiki] (https://github.com/soomla/android-store/wiki) for more information about the project and how to use it better.

Getting Started
---
* Before doing anything, SOOMLA recommends that you go through [Android In-app Billing](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/index.html).

1. Clone android-store. Copy all files from android-store/SoomlaAndroidStore subfolders to their equivalent folders in your Android project:

 `git clone git@github.com:soomla/android-store.git`

2. Make the following changes to your AndroidManifest.xml:

  Add `SoomlaApp` as the main Application by placing it in the `application` tag:

    ```xml
    <application ...
                 android:name="com.soomla.store.SoomlaApp">
    ```

  Add the following permission:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
    ```

  Add the following code into your `application` element:

    ```xml
    <service android:name="com.soomla.billing.BillingService" />

    <receiver android:name="com.soomla.billing.BillingReceiver">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.android.vending.billing.IN_APP_NOTIFY" />
            <action android:name="com.android.vending.billing.RESPONSE_CODE" />
            <action android:name="com.android.vending.billing.PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED" />
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
    ```
3. Change the value of `StoreConfig.SOOM_SEC` to a secret of you choice. Do this now!
   **You can't change this value after you publish your game!**

4. Create your own implementation of _IStoreAssets_ in order to describe your specific game's assets ([example](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/MuffinRushAssets.java)). Initialize _StoreController_ with the class you just created:

      ```Java
       StoreController.getInstance().initialize(new YourStoreAssetsImplementation(),
                                           "[YOUR PUBLIC KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY]",
                                           "[YOUR CUSTOM GAME SECRET HERE]");
      ```

    > The custom secret is your encryption secret for data saved in the DB. This secret is NOT the secret from step 3 (select a different value).

    > Initialize `StoreController` ONLY ONCE when your application loads.

5. Now that you have _StoreController_ loaded, just decide when you want to show/hide your store's UI to the user and let _StoreController_ know about it:

  When you show the store call:

    ```Java
    StoreController.getInstance().storeOpening([the calling Activity]);
    ```

  When you hide the store call:

    ```Java
    StoreController.getInstance().storeClosing();
    ```

And that's it ! You have storage and in-app purchasing capabilities... ALL-IN-ONE.


What's next? In App Purchasing.
---

When we implemented modelV3, we were thinking about ways people buy things inside apps. We figured many ways you can let your users purchase stuff in your game and we designed the new modelV3 to support 2 of them: PurchaseWithMarket and PurchaseWithVirtualItem.

**PurchaseWithMarket** is a PurchaseType that allows users to purchase a VirtualItem with Google Play or with the App Store (through their in-app purchase mechanisms).  
**PurchaseWithVirtualItem** is a PurchaseType that lets your users purchase a VirtualItem with a different VirtualItem. For Example: Buying 1 Sword with 100 Gems.

In order to define the way your various virtual items (Goods, Coins ...) are purchased, you'll need to create your implementation of IStoreAsset (the same one from step 4 in the "Getting Started" above).

Here is an example:

Lets say you have a _VirtualCurrencyPack_ you call `TEN_COINS_PACK` and a _VirtualCurrency_ you call `COIN_CURRENCY`:

```Java
VirtualCurrencyPack TENMUFF_PACK = new VirtualCurrencyPack(
        "10 Coins",                                     // name
        "A pack of 10 coins",                           // description
        "10_coins",                                     // item id
        10,                                             // number of currencies in the pack
        COIN_CURRENCY,                                  // the currency associated with this pack
        new PurchaseWithMarket("com.soomla.ten_coin_pack", 1.99));
```
 
Now you can use _StoreInventory_ to buy this VirtualCurrencyPack:

```Java
StoreInventory.buy(TEN_COINS_PACK);
```
    
And that's it! android-store knows how to contact Google Play for you and will redirect your users to their purchasing system to complete the transaction.
Don't forget to define your _IStoreEventHandler_ in order to get the events of successful or failed purchases (see [Event Handling](https://github.com/soomla/android-store#event-handling)).


Storage & Meta-Data
---

When you initialize _StoreController_, it automatically initializes two other classes: _StorageManager_ and _StoreInfo_. _StorageManager_ is the father of all storage related instances in your game. Use it to access tha balances of virtual currencies and virtual goods (usually, using their itemIds). _StoreInfo_ is the mother of all meta data information about your specific game. It is initialized with your implementation of `IStoreAssets` and you can use it to retrieve information about your specific game.  
We've also added _StoreInventory_ which is a utility class to help you do store related operations even easier.

The on-device storage is encrypted and kept in a SQLite database. SOOMLA is preparing a cloud-based storage service that will allow this SQLite to be synced to a cloud-based repository that you'll define.

**Example Usages**

* Give the user 10 pieces of a virtual currency with itemId "currency_coin":

    ```Java
    StoreInventory.giveVirtualItem("currency_coin", 10);
    ```
    
* Take 10 virtual goods with itemId "green_hat":

    ```Java
    StoreInventory.takeVirtualItem("green_hat", 10);
    ```
    
* Get the current balance of a virtual good with itemId "green_hat" (here we decided to show you the 'long' way. you can also use StoreInventory):

    ```Java
    VirtualGood greenHat = (VirtualGood)StoreInfo.getVirtualItem("green_hat");
    int greenHatsBalance = StorageManager.getVirtualGoodsStorage().getBalance(greenHat);
    ```
    
Security
---

If you want to protect your game from 'bad people' (and who doesn't?!), you might want to follow some guidelines:

+ SOOMLA keeps the game's data in an encrypted database. In order to encrypt your data, SOOMLA generates a private key out of several parts of information. The Custom Secret is one of them. SOOMLA recommends that you provide this value when initializing `StoreController` and before you release your game. BE CAREFUL: You can change this value once! If you try to change it again, old data from the database will become unavailable.
+ Following Google's recommendation, SOOMLA also recommends that you split your public key and construct it on runtime or even use bit manipulation on it in order to hide it. The key itself is not secret information but if someone replaces it, your application might get fake messages that might harm it.

Event Handling
---

For event handling, we use Square's great open-source project [otto](http://square.github.com/otto/). In ordered to be notified of store related events, you can register for specific events and create your game-specific behaviour to handle them.

> Your behaviour is an addition to the default behaviour implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behaviour.

In order to register for events:

1. In the class that should receive the event create a function with the annotation '@Subscribe'. Example:

    ```Java
    @Subscribe public void onPlayPurchaseEvent(PlayPurchaseEvent playPurchaseEvent) {
        ...
    }
    ```
    
2. You'll also have to register your class in the event bus (and unregister when needed):

   ```Java
   BusProvider.getInstance().register(this);
   ```
   
   ```Java
   BusProvider.getInstance().unregister(this);
   ```

> If your class is an Activity, register in 'onResume' and unregister in 'onPause'

You can find a full event handler example [here](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/ExampleEventHandler.java).
